# A2D-Attribute
This is an experiment that treats actor-action as attribute-object.
Inspired by [Attributes as Operators](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Tushar_Nagarajan_Attributes_as_Operators_ECCV_2018_paper.html), we replace the concepts in it:
1. attribute->action
2. object->actor
We want to do the joint actor-action recognition.
The result is competitive with joint recognition. Besides, we obtain a pure action parameters as same as attributes.
